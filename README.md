# 👋 Hi, I'm Hardik

Building systems. Strengthening foundations. Thinking long-term.

## **🚀 About Me**
Based in West Bengal, India
I’m focused on mastering Python from the ground up — not just syntax, but structured system design and disciplined architecture.

Currently working on:
- 🐍 Strengthening Python fundamentals  
- 🧩 Modular system building  
- 🧠 Developing algorithmic thinking  
- ⚙️ Clean project architecture  

I believe in building strong foundations before scaling into advanced fields like AI, backend systems, and cybersecurity.

## **🧠 Philosophy**
- Structure over shortcuts  
- Depth over speed  
- Systems over scripts  
- Consistency over hype
  
I prefer understanding how things work internally rather than relying blindly on tools.
